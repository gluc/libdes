Description: Wrapper around the libdes package. The DES algorithm 
  uses a symmetric key of 56bit length. Today, the algorithm is not considered
  as safe anymore. However, this package can still be useful for interaction with
  legacy applications, such as Bloomberg Datalicense. Also, use this for very
  simple and quick encryption and decryption of files and R objects in situations
  where no military strength security is required.
